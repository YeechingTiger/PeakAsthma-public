  <h4>How NurtiMap Uses Information</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        NurtiMap uses information that you provide and/or that it collects in order to establish and enhance its relationship
        with you and your health related symptoms. NurtiMap generally uses this information to operate, maintain, enhance, and
        provide all of the services and features available to you through website and application usage. This information may
        be used to provide you with reminders, alerts, educational components, new data or content to be transmitted to
        research study personnel in the procurement for research study purposes, as established in participation consent
        documents.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        NurtiMap uses information that you provide or that it collects to keep track of daily logging trends, and to maintain
        features and functionalities of the mHealth website and application.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        NurtiMap research personnel and principal research investigators may have legitimate research reasons to obtain
        access to your personally identifiable information, including but not exclusive to monitoring health related symptoms,
        notifying parent/caregiver/legal authorized representative (LAR) about health related symptoms and suggestions for
        care, and reminders about consistent logging and incentives. NurtiMap reserves the right to share user information with
        people within the ACRI system in relation to the research process, such as study personnel, safety monitoring
        committees, the Institutional Review Board, or ACRI compliance office. Personally identifiable information will not be
        used for any services outside the realm of research practices.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Data minimization: NurtiMap will only access data and personal identifiable information as relating to the usability
        and functionality of the core functions of the website and application. NurtiMap will not access other protected
        resources on your devices, such as photos or contact information. Other than location services and internet access, no
        other outside data or information will be accessed without permissions from the user.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Access: NurtiMap may use "cookies/cache" to maintain information you have previously entered through the app
        services, as a way to remember some of your information, so it does not have to be re-entered each time you enter the
        website or application. Maintaining this information is essential to logging data for health related symptoms and
        metrics, and well as other personally identifiable information to customize your experience with services. NurtiMap
        will respect the user's permission settings and not attempt to manipulate, trick, or force users to consent to
        unnecessary data access. The user will be asking during initial account access whether they want to grant permissions
        to location services and internet access. The user has the right to grant or decline permissions, such as location
        services and internet access, at any point in time, by going in manually and making these changes themselves. In the
        event that this occurs, users must note that these changes may affect the full usage and benefits of third party sites.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Disclosure to Third Parties</h4>
  <p>
    Personal identifiable information will not be transmitted to third parties. Unless otherwise permitted by law or usage
    consent, NurtiMap will not use, transmit, or share user's personal data or information to third parties for any reason.
    Likewise, data collected for one purpose will not be used or repurposed without further consent. User's privacy will be
    respected in accordance with standard Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1966 ("HIPAA"). Proof of
    ethics review board approval is available on upon request.

    Under the terms of this website and application usage, the user, parent/caregiver/legal authorized representative (LAR)
    must consent to participation in study requirement. The user must provide all information necessary to properly use the
    services at full capabilities. This includes providing information to setup a personal profile within the services.

    services. If you register for an account for services, updates or corrections to your account information can be made
    by contacting research personnel to edit personal profile information and preferences at any time. To protect your
    privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your identity, prior to enrollment in the study, and granting
    access to your account for services. However, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your account
    logins and passwords once given to you at the distribution of the website and application services. If at any time you

    that you wish to withdrawal permissions, participation and services with NurtiMap, written notice needs to be sent to

    NurtiMap will not share any health related information from the revocation date forward. Any information obtained prior
    to that date may still be shared to maintain research study reliability. Other extenuating circumstances on temporary
    removal of permissions can be found in Terms of Services and study consent documents.
