  <h3>PEAKmAAP TERMS OF SERVICE</h3>
  <p>
    Important-Read carefully. These terms of service (TOS) are a legal agreement between you and Arkansas Children's
    Research Institute (ACRI). PEAKmAAP is a health services application aiming to provide relevant health information,
    features, functions and additional resources through mobile health (mHealth) platforms and other associated third-party
    vendors. By installing or using PEAKmAAP you are agreeing to these TOS. If you do not agree to these TOS, do not
    install or use PEAKmAAP application, website or services.
  </p>
  <p>
    PEAKmAAP usage is intended for research purposes by individuals who have provided written consent to participate in the
    PEAKmAAP asthma research study. PEAKmAAP is not intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other health
    conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, or prevention and detection of disease.
  </p>
  <p>
    These TOS may be revised or updated periodically. Please revisit this page to stay up-to-date with any changes that may
    be made. Your continued use of services constitutes your agreement to this TOS and its future revisions. You hereby
    acknowledge that PEAKmAAP may be changed, updated or discontinued with or without prior notice. Your use of PEAKmAAP
    may be suspended or terminated with notice if you breach these TOS or engage in any illegal, inappropriate, or
    prohibited behavior, such as the rooting, decompiling or reverse engineering of your mobile device or any of its
    software. To the extent of any conflict between these TOS and any other terms and conditions you have agreed to
    regarding your use of your mobile device, these TOS will prevail.
  </p>
  <p>
    PEAKmAAP may help you manage your overall wellness by providing relevant reference information and tools, including
    tools to help you track your asthma symptoms, peak flow readings, and manage your overall asthma conditions. You can
    also check PEAKmAAP and manage your data by logging in to your PEAKmAAP settings. PEAKmAAP is not practicing medicine
    or any healthcare through its services and/or any such Third-Party Services. Your interaction with PEAKmAAP is not
    intended to take the place of your relationship with your regular healthcare providers.
  </p>
  <p>
    The goal of PEAKmAAP is to learn more about how to help adolescents who have asthma. The use of PEAKmAAP will help
    researchers find out if a mobile asthma action plan (PEAKmAAP) will help adolescents/young adults. Using PEAKmAAP will
    not restrict any medical care you could or will receive from any facility, including Arkansas Children's Hospital, if
    you decide not to participate. While using PEAKmAAP, you will be informed of any new information learned that might
    affect whether you wish to continue in the research study. The administrators of PEAKmAAP want the participant to be
    informed about anything that may change their mind in regards study participation. If at any point before, during,
    and/or after the participant accesses PEAKmAAP, their questions can be answered by PEAKmAAP administration. The
    administrators will inform the participant of changes by calling, sending a letter and email, or telling the
    participant at the research study follow up visits.
  </p>
  <p>
    To gain access to PEAKmAAP, an eligibility screening process will be conducted. The participant will be asked questions
    about their asthma and current medications. If the participant qualifies, to be in the research study the following
    things will occur:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Upon distribution into study groups, the participant may be assigned to different levels of app usage.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>PEAKmAAP Group-</b> The PEAKmAAP group will use a mobile "app" that will help manage asthma. The participant will be asked
              to enter asthma health symptoms or peak flow readings daily. The participant will log asthma health symptoms if they
              worsen. PEAKmAAP will prompt the participant to take their asthma medication and sends reminders to take their
              medicines if notices are delayed. The participant will also get reminders when it is time to get asthma medicines
              refilled at the pharmacy. The participant will get asthma education messages and video links. PEAKmAAP will advise the
              participant on when to seek medical care. The administrators will phone call/SMS or email to check that the participant
              received medical care.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>PEAKmAAP-DS Group-</b> This group has the same "app" as the PEAKmAAP group. After giving consent/assent, the primary care
              provider (PCP) of participants in this group, will receive a report monthly. This report will be generated from
              information that the participant enters in the PEAKmAAP and from the monthly surveys. The report will help the
              participant's doctor know about his/her asthma symptoms over time.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    The administrators will ask the participant, parent/caregiver/legal authorized representative (LAR) to answer more
    questions about the study participant's asthma throughout the study period. Some questions will be asked when attending
    doctor's visits at the beginning of the study, at 3 months and 12 months. Some questions will be asked by online
    survey. The participant will get a link to a survey every month for 12 months. Online surveys will take 5-10 minutes to
    complete.
  </p>
  <p>
    Along with PEAKmAAP usage the participant will continue to get their usual asthma care from their regular doctor. The
    administrators will not give medical advice. The administrators will also send reminders to you about the online survey
    questions if you forget. The administrators will look at prescription refill lists from your insurance company or
    pharmacy to see when the participant gets their medicines refilled. The administrator will look at these reports for
    the 12 month time period before enrolling in the study and 12 months during the study enrollment. These reports will
    help the administrators know if any of the participant's asthma medicines change. The administrators will get
    information from medical records and collect this information for twelve months. The administrators will collect asthma
    diagnosis, medications, asthma action plan and medical history as a part of the PEAKmAAP study.
  </p>
  <h4>Authorization to Share Personal Health Information:</h4>
  <p>
    The word "you" means both the person who takes part in the research, and the person who gives permission to be in the
    research. We are asking you to take part in the research described in the consent form. To conduct this research in
    conjunction with PEAKmAAP, we need to collect health information that identifies the participant. We may collect
    information from the participant's medical record, information concerning his/her name, address, phone number, social
    security number, date of birth, medical history, and medications. We will also collect data from your participant's
    medical chart, such as the date of asthma diagnosis and asthma action plan. We will ask questions about asthma and
    whether the participant will know what to do during a serious asthma attack. This information will be used for the
    purpose of examining the effectiveness of the personalized, interactive asthma smartphone app in reducing asthma
    disease among adolescents/young adults who are at greater risk for future asthma attacks. We will only collect
    information that is needed for the research. Participating in this research study will create new health information
    about asthma. The information created will be
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><p>Asthma control and self-management using an app</p></li>
    <li><p>Understanding asthma medicines</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>For the participant to be in this research, we need permission to collect, create, and share this information.</p>
  <p>
    We will, or may share the participant's health information with people at the hospital who help with the research or
    things related to the research process, such as the study staff, the Safety Monitoring Committee, the Institutional
    Review Board, and the research compliance office at ACRI. We may also share the participant's information with the
    Sponsor or their representative that pays for the research or works with us on the research and people outside of the
    hospital who are in charge of the research, insuring proper research protocol. Some of these people may share health
    information with someone else. If they do, the same laws that Arkansas Children's Hospital and ACRI must obey may not
    apply; therefore, information may be re-disclosed by the recipient and is no longer protected under the Health
    Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). This authorization to collect, use and share health information
    does not expire.
    If you sign this form to initiate participation and PEAKmAAP access, we will create, collect, use and share the
    participant's health information until the end of the research project. PEAKmAAP and ACRI may keep all the information
    in case needed to access it again. We will protect the information and keep it confidential. If the participant signs
    this form, he/she are giving us permission to create, collect, use, and share health information. The participant does
    not have to sign this form. However, if they decide not to sign this form, they cannot acquire access to PEAKmAAP or
    have participation the research study.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the participant changes their mind later and do not want us to collect or share health information, they need to
    send a letter to: Arkansas Children's Hospital, 13 Children's Way, Slot 512-13, Little Rock, AR 72202. The letter needs
    to be signed by the participant, should list the "Study Title" listed on this form and should state that they have
    changed their mind and are revoking their "HIPAA Research Authorization". If the HIPAA authorization is revoked, the
    participant will no longer be a part of the research study and we cannot share any more health information from the
    revocation date forward. However, in order to maintain the reliability of the information from the research, we may
    still use and share information that was collected prior to receiving your letter withdrawing the permissions granted
    under this authorization.
  </p>
  <h4>PEAKmAAP Access Duration:</h4>
  <p>
    The research study will take five years to complete and each participant will be enrolled in the PEAKmAAP study for 12
    months. The first visit and app distribution will occur after signing the consent form. The administrators will not
    collect information after active enrollment ends.
  </p>
  <p>
    The research team will know the participant's name and see his/her collected information. The administrators will do
    their best to make sure no one outside the study is aware of study participation. The participant's name will be
    removed from study documents and replaced with an ID number, to ensure person security throughout the study. The
    administrators may share the results of the study at meetings and in medical journals, but will not include the
    participant's name, address, phone number, email or any other personal identifiable information.
  </p>
  <p>
    Federal and state agencies like the National Institute of Health (NIH), Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP),
    Institutional Review Board and other ACRI institutional oversight offices may see information about the participant,
    while overseeing study details. Under Arkansas state law, the administrator is required to notify the authorities if
    they learn about possible abuse; or that the participant might hurt his/herself or someone else.
  </p>
  <p>
    The participant's information will be coded and stored in a locked office at ACRI. The information will be destroyed
    per ACRI policy, and the information collected cannot be given back. The administrator and ACRI biostatistics team will
    have access to the code for the participant's information.
  </p>
  <p>
    The participant can terminate access to PEAKmAAP at any time. In the event that the participant wish to terminate
    participation in the study, he/she can call the administrator at 888-249-2830. PEAKmAAP access can be revoked by
    administration if the participant does not follow study instructions, if it is not in the participant's best interest
    to continue or if the study is stopped for any reason. The administrator will call or write a letter that will give the
    reason for termination. This reason will also be recorded in the participant's study file.
  </p>
  <h4>RISK:</h4>
  <p>There are no more risks of using PEAKmAAP other than what happens in everyday life.</p>
