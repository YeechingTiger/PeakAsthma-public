    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>How PEAKmAAp Uses Information</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        PEAKmAAP uses information that you provide and/or that it collects in order to establish and enhance its relationship
        with you and your asthma related symptoms. PEAKmAAP generally uses this information to operate, maintain, enhance, and
        provide all of the services and features available to you through website and application usage. This information may be
        used to provide you with reminders, alerts, educational components, new data or content to be transmitted to your
        primary care physician and to research study personnel in the procurement for research study purposes, as established in
        participation consent documents.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        PEAKmAAP uses information that you provide or that it collects to keep track of daily logging trends, and to maintain
        features and functionalities of the mHealth website and application.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        PEAKmAAP research personnel and principal research investigators may have legitimate research reasons to obtain access
        to your personally identifiable information, including but not exclusive to monitoring health related symptoms,
        contacting primary care physicians, notifying parent/caregiver/legal authorized representative (LAR) about health
        related symptoms and suggestions for care, and reminders about consistent logging and incentives. PEAKmAAP reserves the
        right to share user information with people within the ACRI system in relation to the research process, such as study
        personnel, safety monitoring committees, the Institutional Review Board, or ACRI compliance office. Personally
        identifiable information will not be used for any services outside the realm of research practices.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Data minimization: PEAKmAAP will only access data and personal identifiable information as relating to the usability
        and functionality of the core functions of the website and application. PEAKmAAP will not access other protected
        resources on your devices, such as photos or contact information. Other than location services, no other outside data or
        information will be accessed without permissions from the user.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Access: PEAKmAAP may use "cookies/cache" to maintain information you have previously entered through the app services,
        as a way to remember some of your information, so it does not have to be re-entered each time you enter the website or
        application. Maintaining this information is essential to logging data for health related symptoms and metrics, and well
        as other personally identifiable information to customize your experience with services. PEAKmAAP will respect the
        user's permission settings and not attempt to manipulate, trick, or force users to consent to unnecessary data access.
        The user will be asking during initial account access whether they want to grant permissions to location services. The
        user has the right to grant or decline permissions, such as location services, at any point in time, by going in
        manually and making these changes themselves. In the event that this occurs, users must note that these changes may
        affect the full usage and benefits of third party sites and plug-ins, such as Google Maps API or AccuWeather API.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Disclosure to Third Parties</h4>
  <p>
    Personal identifiable information will not be transmitted to third parties. Unless otherwise permitted by law or usage
    consent, PEAKmAAP will not use, transmit, or share user's personal data or information to third parties for any reason.
    Likewise, data collected for one purpose will not be used or repurposed without further consent. User's privacy will be
    respected in accordance with standard Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1966 ("HIPAA"). Proof of
    ethics review board approval is available on upon request.
  </p>

    Under the terms of this website and application usage, the user, parent/caregiver/legal authorized representative (LAR)
    must consent to participation in study requirement. The user must provide all information necessary to properly use the
    services at full capabilities. This includes providing information to setup a personal profile within the services.
    Without information PEAKmAAP may not be able to provide to you some of the features and functionalities found on or
    through services. If you register for an account for services, updates or corrections to your account information can be
    made by contacting research personnel to edit personal profile information and preferences at any time. To protect your
    privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your identity, prior to enrollment in the study, and granting
    access to your account for services. However, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your account
    logins and passwords once given to you at the distribution of the website and application services. If at any time you
    choose to terminate permissions, participation and services with PEAKmAAP, you have the right to do so. In the event
    that you wish to withdrawal permissions, participation and services with PEAKmAAP, written notice needs to be sent to

    signed, including the "Study Title" and state that you wish to revoke your "HIPAA Research Authorization". Thereafter,
    PEAKmAAP will not share any health related information from the revocation date forward. Any information obtained prior
    to that date may still be shared to maintain research study reliability. Other extenuating circumstances on temporary
    removal of permissions can be found in Terms of Services and study consent documents.

  <h4>Our Commitment to Data Security</h4>
  <p>

    contacting the user and/or the parent/caregiver/legal authorized representative (LAR) so that you can take appropriate
    protective measures. At the conclusion of the PEAKmAAP mHealth study, personal information and data acquired will be
    destroyed, as stated in the consent process and Terms of Service.
